  <h1>Base rules</h1>
  <p>
    The rules are what you can convince your opponent to accept. However, we
    recommend:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>All pieces are Horse (King is Horse but acts as a King piece)</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Variations</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Act of god: third parties may intervene, however they should try to be
      fair to both players.
    </li>
    <li>Each piece retains its original move set but has an L shape.</li>
    <li>Each player brings their own horses (like Warhammer)</li>
    <li>Horses must kiss before winning</li>
    <!-- <li>The Queens cannot kill each other because they are lesbians having an affair</li> -->
  </ol>
